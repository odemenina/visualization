# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

Explain in details along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization as good or bad. 300 words for your good example and 500 for bad one
Let's start with a good visualization example.





Good Visualization Example: 
I evaluated diagram ![alt text](<persent change in cases deaths per 10 000  US pop 2000-2016 cancer_drops.jpg>) as a good one!
The attached image showcases percentage change in incidence and mortality rates for various types of tumors per 100,000 US population from 2000 to 2016. 
This visualization is good one for several reasons:

1. Purpose: This chart highlights remarkable progress in cancer prevention and treatment over a 16-year period.

2. Clarity and Readability: The diagram effectively represents complex data in a clear, contextual and visually appealing way. The x-axis (%) and y-axis (tumor type) are clear and readable, tumor types are distinguished by colors, percentage changes for each tumor type are clearly shown.

3. Scale: The scale is appropriate for the data being presented, allowing for clear visualization. 

4. Legends and Annotations: The diagram includes labels that are consistent, well-organized and let viewers make distinguish between different types of tumors and color-coded data points. 

5. Data structure: The data is structured in a logical and coherent manner, allowing easily compare incidence and mortality rates for different tumor types. The helps viewers quickly understand the trends and draw meaningful conclusions.

6. Contextual Information: The diagram provides essential context, such as the time frame (2000-2016) and the population size (per 100,000 US population). 

7. Visual Appeal: The map is aesthetically pleasing, with a clean and professionally design that makes it engaging and easy to explore.

The diagram demonstrates significant strides in reducing the impact of cancer on the population, with many tumor types showing impressive declines in mortality rates. This progress inspires optimism and emphasizes the importance of continued research, early detection, and prevention efforts to further combat cancer.






Bad Visualization Example:
I evaluated diagram ![alt text](<Medication abortions in the USA in 2000-2022.png>) as a bad one.
The diagram illustrating the percentage of medical abortions in the U.S. from 2000 to 2022 can be evaluated as follows:

1. Purpose: The diagram aims to depict the increase in medical abortions over period 2000-2022. 

2. Clarity and Readability: The diagram has a clear layout, but its design is overly eye-catching, which can potentially distract viewers from the actual data. An effective plot should strike a balance between visual appeal and data clarity, ensuring the viewer's focus remains on the data presented. In this case, the striking design, while visually engaging, risks overshadowing the information being conveyed, which can detract from the overall effectiveness of the visualization.

3. Scale: The vertical axis is appropriately scaled, starting from zero, which allows for proper visual comparison of changes in the percentage of medical abortions. 
However, the horizontal axis plots points at equal distances, regardless of the time intervals between them. This distorts the perceived rate of change, making it seem like there was a significant increase after 2001, even though the next data point is four years away.

4. Legends and Annotations: A significant flaw in this diagram is the absence of labels on both the vertical and horizontal axes. Viewers are forced to guess what the data points represent, leading to possible misinterpretations. 

5. Data Structure: Although the data structure clearly shows the trend of increasing medical abortions, it lacks comparisons to other relevant data, such as the overall number of abortions (that are medical and non-medical) or the percentage of total  medical abortions. 
The diagram also fails to specify the proportion of the population on which the statistical results are based. It's unclear whether the data represents the percentage of medical abortions per 100,000 women or the entire female population. This omission is critical, as it impacts the interpretation of the data as the population is also increased for the period 2000-2022.

6. Contextual Information: The diagram conveys a negative emotional tone, suggesting an increase in medical abortions without explaining its significance or providing any context. This one-sided presentation can bias viewers' perceptions. 

7. Visual Appeal: The diagram uses good color contrast, making it visually distinct and easy to differentiate between data points. However, excessive use of vibrant colors can sometimes overwhelm negative impact on viewers. The goal should be to use color strategically to highlight important trends and differences without creating unnecessary distractions.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
 
Recommendations for Improvement
1. Add Clear Labels: Ensure both the vertical and horizontal axes have clear and concise labels with units of measurement and time periods. 

2. Correct Time Intervals: Adjust the horizontal axis to reflect the actual time intervals between data points.

3. Specify Population Proportion: Clearly indicate whether the data represents the percentage per 100,000 women or the entire female population. This clarification will help viewers better understand the scope and scale of the data.

4. Improve Emotional Balance: Avoid using design elements that imply a negative emotional tone. Aim for a neutral and informative presentation that allows viewers to form their own conclusions based on the data.

5. Simplify the Design: Reduce excessive decorative elements or overly vibrant colors that may distract from the data.

By implementing these recommendations, the diagram can be significantly improved, creating a more accurate, informative, and engaging visualization.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
